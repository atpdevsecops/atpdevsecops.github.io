Welcome to my blog. I use this space to reflect on my progress, document my process, and share how I use AI tools to accelerate my learning in the DevSecOps field.

## ðŸš€ First Project: Secure Note App

My first project using Flask, Docker, and GitHub Actions with Trivy scanning.  
I built it almost entirely using AI assistance and learned:
- How CI/CD pipelines are structured
- What Trivy does and how it scans containers
- How secrets and vulnerabilities are caught during builds
